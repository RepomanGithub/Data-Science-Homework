This project is being carried out as part of an Udacity Course and starts with three 
stakeholder questions to AirBnB data sets from Boston from 2016/2017/2018/2019. 
To answer the questions, a Juypter notebook was implemented using the 
CIRSP-DM process. Data is read, processed, modeled and evaluated in this notebook.

Getting Started

Python 2.5 or higher must be used to use the notebook. In addition, 
the Anaconda Navigator 1.9.7 was used as well as Jupyter Notebook 6.0.0. 
This software and development environment should be installed for use. 
A Jupyternotebook can then be loaded in Anaconda and the notebook can be executed. 
The data used was generated from data on the AirBnB website and is included 
with the project.

Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how

Data

The data set used is a summary of all listings of lots from 2016,2017,2018,2019 with 
pre-selected data which are relevant to answering the questions. 
The original data is included as a ZIP and can be used to create the 
file added_Master_Boston.csv.
